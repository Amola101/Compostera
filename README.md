An app to check if your compost is efficient to use.


### Inspiration
I always lived in the city and the older I got the more consciences about the environment. This led me to create my own compost in my apartment. But when I observed other parts of where I lived I noticed no a lot of people have compost but they have space for it. This leads me to the conclusion that they didn't have the materials nor knowledge about making compost. People in cities can make

### What it does
It uses an ai cam to see if your compost is ready to use..

### How we built it
This was built using the common standard web languages (HTML, CSS and J) and using hardware.

### Challenges we ran into
This is our first time doing a hardware project. At first, we didn't have the materials we need to create it but thanks to our ingenuity we discovered new ways to make it possible, and now we have a compost thermometer on our website.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that the general ui looks decent and the fact we could create the project in the short space of time given.

### What we learned
We learnt that communication is key for stuff like this and sometimes going for more simple features is better.

### What's next for Compostera
We are planning on adding a fully functional thermometre, and we also want to make the site fully responsive, and add more features.
